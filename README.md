This is a 90's party video jukebox. Designed to be cast to a Chromecast from a web browser tab in full screen mode. Pulls videos from YouTube.

* Press ```r``` to reset the playlist to the beginning
* Press ```n``` to play the next song (or click on the message bar)
* Press ```p``` to play/pause

Edit videos.js to change the list of songs and the onscreen message displayed with each song.

Needs to be served from a webserver. You can do that locally with Python by running
```
python -m http.server
```

Code is super hacky, don't hold it against me :)
